        <h2>Built by a Single Developer</h2>
        <p>
            I created this website as a personal project to merge my love for movies and my passion for coding. As a solo developer, I strive to provide you with a clean, intuitive interface, and a fast, responsive site that will enhance your movie discovery experience.
        </p>

        <h2>Why I Built This Website</h2>
        <p>
            As a huge fan of movies, I was always looking for a platform where I could easily browse, discover, and keep up with the latest movie trends. Many sites had either too much clutter or didn’t offer the functionalities I needed. That’s why I decided to build this site from scratch, keeping it simple, functional, and focused on what matters most: delivering the best movie experience.
        </p>
